These are the files that I use to configure Emacs.  This README also serves as a place for me to list the modes that I am planning to explore more in the future.

      - To send content to nodejs-repl C-u (1 - 3 times) followed by C-c C-z

    skewer-mode
      - M-x run-skewer to attach to a browser
      - C-c C-z to open the REPL
